                            Enter your pledge amount and select a premium. (You may select a premium at any level up to and including the amount you pledge.)  If you pledge enough, you're also eligible to be credited in the unglued ebook and to include a dedication, and toward the bottom of this page you can specify what you'd like those to say.  After you click Pledge, you'll be directed through Amazon to complete the transaction.

                            Yes.  We know this is an obstacle for some users, and we apologize.  Unfortunately we cannot offer other options at this time.  There are more details at <a href="http://blog.unglue.it/2012/05/03/unglue-it-payment-options-amazon-vs-paypal/">our blog</a>.

                            <span class="menu level2 answer">
                            We're sorry, but no.  At this time PayPal and Amazon are the only payment processors which support pledges (rather than immediate charges).  While we're working on adding PayPal support, we don't yet have all the approvals we need to do so.

                            <span class="menu level2 answer">
                            Campaigns succeed if they reach their target price by their deadline.  If this campaign succeeds, you'll be charged within a day of when it reaches its target.  If it does not, your pledge will expire on {{ campaign.deadline }} (Eastern US time) and you will not be charged.

                            <span class="menu level2 answer">
                            You can change or cancel your pledge at any time before the campaign ends.  This will be the campaign's deadline ({{ campaign.deadline }}) or midnight (Eastern US time) on the day the campaign succeeds, whichever comes first.  Go to <a href="{% url work work.id %}">this book's page</a> and click on the Modify Pledge button.

                            If the campaign succeeds and you requested a special premium, we will disclose to the rights holder your email address and any premiums you requested.  The rights holder will then be in touch with you about how your premiums will be fulfilled.  If you asked to be listed in the acknowledgements, this will be part of the unglued ebook, which should be emailed to you within 90 days of the close of the campaign.
