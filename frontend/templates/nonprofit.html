	<div><h1>Supporting <i>{{ get.title }}</i> through {{nonprofit.name}}</h1>
		<div><p>{{nonprofit.name}} is cooperating with Unglue.it to make books free to the world. On this page, you can make a donation to us, and we'll hold the money until the ungluing campaign you've selected succeeds. Then we'll make a payment to the rightsholder along side unglue.it. Once you've made the donation, we'll ad donation credits to your unglue.it account, <code>{{get.username}}</code>. 
		</p>
		<p>
		To fund the pledge of ${{get.preapproval_amount|intcomma}} that you've made at unglue.it, you'll need to make a donation of at least that amount. You can donate more than that of course- you'll get additional donation credits to use on other campaigns. The larger your donation, the less percentage-wise that gets eaten up by processing fees.
		</p>
		<p>Any interest we earn will be used for our public purpose of helping libraries remain relevant into the future. If your unglue.it donation credits don't get used for 5 years, we'll use it in the same way. Your donation to {{nonprofit.name}} is deductible as a Charitable donation in the US.</p>
