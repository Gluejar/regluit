        Do you have a <b>book you love so much</b> you'd like to give it to the world?  At Unglue.it, you can.
    </p>
    <p>
		We want everyone to be able to read beloved books -- for free, on their favorite devices, worldwide. We also want the book creators to earn a living.  Traditionally, readers pay <i>every</i> time they buy a book.  But what if it worked more like public radio?  What if creators got enough money to cover their costs and make their efforts worthwhile, and then the book were free to all?  That's what Unglue.it does.   Creators decide what how much they need to earn, and then, through campaigns at Unglue.it, people everywhere chip in -- people like you.

    	If <span class="ungluer"></span>'s favorite books had ungluing campaigns running right now, you'd see them here.  Every time an Ungluer like <span class="ungluer"></span> buys an ebook, or pledges to support one, the day comes closer when the book will be free to everyone.   And when that happens, the books become free for you, and everyone else, to read and share.

        What if your favorite book were on this list?
