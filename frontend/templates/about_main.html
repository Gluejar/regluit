        <b>What if you could</b> give a book to everyone on earth?  Get an ebook and read it on any device, in any format, forever? Give an ebook to your library, for them to share?  Own DRM-free ebooks, legally?  Read free ebooks, and know their creators had been fairly paid?
    </p>
    <p>
        At Unglue.it, you can pledge toward creating ebooks that will be legally free, worldwide.  These books have already been traditionally published, but they're stuck: legal restrictions keep you from being able to enjoy and share them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unglue.it gets them unstuck.  Authors and publishers decide what amount lets them freely share their books with the world while still making a living.  We raise that fee here through crowdfunding: people like you chipping in.  When campaigns succeed, authors and publishers get paid, and they issue a free electronic edition under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> license.

        What if you could give your favorite book to the world?
