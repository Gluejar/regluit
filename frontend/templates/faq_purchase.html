                            <span class="menu level2 answer">
                            NO. However, each purchased book you download from unglue.it is personalized with your unglue.it username and your personal license certificate. You must not make copies of personal ebooks for your friends; if you do so so your license may be revoked and the rightsholders may get mad at you. To share ebooks, you can purchase Unglue.it library licenses!
