		<div class="text"><b>Raymond Yee</b> is a data architect, author, consultant, and teacher.  He is author of the leading book on web mashups, <a href="http://blog.mashupguide.net/2008/02/29/the-book-is-available-now/">Pro Web 2.0 Mashups: Remixing Data and Web Services</a> (published by Apress and licensed under a Creative Commons license), and has numerous blogs at his <a href="http://raymondyee.net/">personal site</a>.   At the UC Berkeley School of Information, he taught Mixing and Remixing Information, a course on using APIs to create mashups.  An open data and open government afficionado, he recently co-wrote three influential reports on how the US government can improve its efforts to make data and services available through APIs. Raymond served as the Integration Advisor for the Zotero Project (a widely used open source research tool) and managed the <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/zoterocommons">Zotero Commons</a>, a collaboration between George Mason University and the Internet Archive. Raymond has been an invited speaker about web technology at the Library of Congress, Fashion Institute of Technology, the O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference, American Library Association, the Open Education conference, Code4lib, Educause, and NISO. While earning a Ph.D. in biophysics, he taught computer science, philosophy, and personal development to middle and high school students in the Academic Talent Development Program on the Berkeley campus. Raymond is an erstwhile tubaist, admirer of J. S. Bach, and son of industrious Chinese-Canadian restaurateurs.<br /><br />
		
		At Gluejar, the interfaces we will expose to other websites and the data mash-ups we'll support will be just as important as the website itself. Expect that any webpage -- book blog, Facebook page, or library online catalog -- will be able to combine book data and user interaction with the effort of nudging the book towards Open Access. Raymond's expertise will make this possible.</div>
