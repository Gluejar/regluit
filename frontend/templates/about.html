		<div class="text"><b>Amanda Mecke</b> is an expert in literary rights management. Before founding her own <a href="http://www.ameckeco.com/">literary agency</a>, Amanda was VP, Director of Subsidiary Rights for Bantam Dell, a division of Random House Inc. from 1989-2003, where she led a department that sold international and domestic book rights and pioneered early electronic licenses for subscription databases, CD-ROMs, audiobooks, and ebooks. She was also a co-leader of the Random House/SAP Contracts and Royalties software development team. Prior to joining Bantam Dell, Amanda ran the New York marketing office of the University of California Press.  While there she served the board of the American Association of University Presses and was President of Women in Scholarly Publishing. Amanda has been a speaker at the Frankfurt Book Messe Rights Workshop, NYU Summer Publishing Program, American Independent Writers conference, and the International Women’s Writers Guild. She has a B.A. from Pitzer College, Claremont, California and a Ph.D. in English from UCLA.  Amanda continues to represent original work by her literary agency clients.<br /><br />

		Amanda will be spending much of her time reaching out to authors, publishers, and other rights holders and identifying works that will attract financial support from book lovers who want to see the ebooks available for free to anyone, anywhere. Her experience in both trade and academic publishing, together with her keen insight into the world of book rights, stood her above a lot of great people who expressed interest in working for Gluejar.</div>

At the UC Berkeley School of Information, he taught Mixing and Remixing Information, a course on using APIs to create mashups.  An open data and open government afficionado, he recently co-wrote three influential reports on how the US government can improve its efforts to make data and services available through APIs. Raymond served as the Integration Advisor for the Zotero Project (a widely used open source research tool) and managed the <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/zoterocommons">Zotero Commons</a>, a collaboration between George Mason University and the Internet Archive. Raymond has been an invited speaker about web technology at the Library of Congress, Fashion Institute of Technology, the O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference, American Library Association, the Open Education conference, Code4lib, Educause, and NISO.

		Recently, Raymond has been teaching a course at UC Berkeley's School of Information science on working with Open Data; with any luck, the textbook he's working on will be a subject of a future ungluing campaign!</div>

As a speaker of French, English, Spanish and German, he has incredible insight into the various ways in which similar phenomena get interpreted through the prism of language.<br /><br />

Luc is joining Gluejar as a paid intern, and feels tremendously privileged to work on a project that celebrates Creative Commons and disruptive publishing models.	</div>
