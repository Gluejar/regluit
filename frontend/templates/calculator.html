<h4> Buy-to-Unglue Campaigns</h4>
<dl>
<dt>What is Buy-to-Unglue?</dt>

<dd>Buy-to-Unglue is a program that uses sales revenue to push books into the public commons. Every book that gets purchased through Unglue.it brings the ungluing date closer to the present.</dd>
<dt>What is an Ungluing Date?</dt>

<dd>The ungluing date is the date a book gets released under a Creative Commons License. After the ungluing date, the ebook will be available for free at unglue.it, Internet Archive and any library, anywhere.</dd>
<dt>How does that work?</dt>
<dd>The rights holder for the book picks <ol>
<li>an initial ungluing date some time in the future, and </li>
<li>a revenue goal</li>
</ol> When an ebook license is purchased, the ungluing date is recalculated according to these formulae:<pre> 
(days per dollar) = [(initial ungluing date) - (campaign launch date)] / (campaign goal)

(current ungluing date) = (initial ungluing date) - (gross revenue)*(days per dollar)
</pre>
Here's a calculator you can use to see how this works:
<div class="std_form">
<div class=" work_campaigns">
<form  action="#calculator" method="POST"  style="margin:5px" id="calculator">
{% csrf_token %}
<p>Starting with an Initial Ungluing Date of
{{ form.cc_date_initial.errors }}{{ form.cc_date_initial }}</p>
<p>and a revenue goal of 
{{ form.target.errors }}${{ form.target }},</p>

{% if form.instance.dollar_per_day %}

<p>When the Book has earned 
${{ form.revenue.errors }}{{ form.revenue }}, the new Ungluing Date will be <span class="call-to-action">{{ form.instance.cc_date }}</span> and every additional <span class="call-to-action">${{ form.instance.dollar_per_day|floatformat:2|intcomma }}</span> received will advance the Ungluing Date by one day.</p>

<p><input type="submit" value="Calculate"  /> another Ungluing Date</p>
{% else %}
<p>when the Book has earned ...<br />
${{ form.revenue.errors }}{{ form.revenue }}

<input type="submit" value="Calculate"  /> a new Ungluing Date</p>

{% endif %}
</dd>
<dt>How do I tell what a book's ungluing date is?</dt>
<dd>The ungluing date is displayed on the campaign page for every Buy-to-Unglue book, and is printed inside every copy sold through Unglue.it on the license/copyright page. For ebooks sold anywhere else, you'll need to wait for the author(s) to die, and many decades after that, for the copyright to expire.</dd>
