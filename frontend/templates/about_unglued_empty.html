        Imagine if <b>you could give your favorite book</b> to everyone on earth.  Imagine if they all had a copy that they could read anywhere, anytime, on their favorite devices, with no DRM.  That they could share with their friends, freely and legally.  And imagine that your favorite book's creators still got paid.

    	It's possible!  You are free to read, copy, and share books that are in the public domain or have been released to the world under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> license.  Under some licenses, you're also free to remix them into new creative works.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Here at Unglue.it, we help you pay creators to unglue their books.  What's that mean?  First, book creators say what amount would make it worth their while to issue their books under Creative Commons licenses.  Next, they run Pledge Campaigns on Unglue.it, and anyone who wants to give their book to the world chips in.  When the campaign succeeds, we pay the book creators, and they issue a freely available ebook.  When books <span class="ungluer"></span> loves are unglued, you'll see them here.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now imagine, what if your favorite book were on this list?

        What if you could <b>unglue it</b>?
