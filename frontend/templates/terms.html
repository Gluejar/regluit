<a id="rightsholders"><h3>Campaigns: Additional Terms for Rights Holders</h3></a>
<p>
The Company's mission is to make copyrighted literary works freely and readily available to all who wish to read them in digital form, while ensuring that authors, publishers and other copyright owners are compensated for their efforts and investment in creating and developing such works.  </p>

<p>The Company invites and encourages Rights Holders to propose Works for Creative Commons licensing via Unglue.it Campaigns.  Rights Holders have to apply to the Company to initiate campaigns and, upon acceptance, the Rights Holder must enter into a Platform Services Agreement with the Company prior to starting an Unglue.it Campaign.</p>

<p>Rights Holders who have executed a Platform Services Agreement may claim works and may initiate and conduct Campaigns as described in the Rights Holder Tools page at <a href="http://unglue.it/rightsholders/">http://unglue.it/rightsholders/</a>.</p>

<p>There is no charge for Rights Holders to launch and fund a Campaign using the Service. However, the Company will withhold a “Sales Commission”  of 6% of gross aggregate Contributions upon the completion of a successful Campaign. The Rights Holder is responsible for providing a Standard Ebook File at their own expense, as described in a Platform Services Agreement. </p>

<p>The Rights Holder hereby authorizes the Company to use the Service to display and market the Subject Work, to collect Contributions or cause Contributions to be collected from Supporters on behalf of the Rights Holder, and to retain, reserve and/or distribute the Contributions to the Rights Holder, to the Company, to Designated Vendors (as defined below) or otherwise pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  </p>

<p>The Rights Holder acknowledges and understands that the Company uses one or more third party payment processing services to collect Contributions and/or for the distribution of Contributions to the Rights Holder or otherwise pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (the “Payment Processor.”) The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to select Payment Processors for this purpose and to change Payment Processors at any time, with or without notice to the Rights Holder.

The Rights Holder understands and agrees that the Company may hold funds for up to 90 days following the conclusion of an Unglue.it Campaign, pending proof of fulfillment by the Rights Holder, and that Payment Processors may withhold funds for various reasons according to their own terms of service.</p>

<p>Paypal is one of the Payment Processors that the Company may use from time to time as part of the Service.  In order to launch a Campaign, Rights Holders must have a Paypal account and agree to Paypal's terms and conditions. </p>

<p>The duration of any single Unglue.it Campaign shall be determined by the Rights Holder, provided that no single Unglue.it Campaign shall be longer than one hundred eighty (180) days.</p>

<p>No Premium may be offered on the Website that constitutes an illegal, prohibited or restricted item in the United States.  Items that are prohibited or restricted by the Company  include, but are not limited to, alcoholic beverages, firearms, knives or other weapons, drugs, drug-like substances and paraphernalia, counterfeit currency and stamps, credit cards, electronic surveillance equipment, hazardous materials, medical devices, or any other item that is illegal.  The Company reserves the right to remove Premium items from the Website in its sole discretion and without notice to the Rights Holder.</p>

<p>The Rights Holder shall not, whether as a Premium or otherwise, use the Service to offer any financial incentive to potential Supporters.  The prohibition against financial incentives expressly includes, but is not limited to, a share of profits or ownership interest in any entity, interest payable on any Contributions, or any Premium that would require registration under the securities laws of any country or state, including but not limited to the state or federal securities laws and regulations of the United States.</p>

<li>The file shall contain front matter which includes the following:
<ul class="terms">
<li>a list of ISBNs of other editions of the work</li>
<li>the Creative Commons license selected for the campaign, formatted in accordance with best practices at <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Marking/Creators">http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Marking/Creators</a>, and a statement that for the purposes of the license, "Non-Commercial" use shall include, but not be limited to, the distribution of the Work by a commercial entity without charge.</li>
<li>an acknowledgement of supporters of the work, formatted in accordance with the premium descriptions on the Campaign page.</li>

<li>the text “CC edition release enabled by Unglue.it users” (including the hyperlink to the site)</li>

</ul></li>
<li>The cover graphic shall match any description given in the Campaign.</li>
<li>Any graphics which must be excluded from the released ebook shall be specified in the description given in the campaign.
</ul>

<p>To provide confirmation of Fulfillment and become eligible to receive Contributions made  in a successful Campaign, the Rights Holder shall make either make available to the Company a Standard Ebook File for the work, or the Rights Holder shall designate a third party vendor from a list of vendors approved by the Company (the “Designated Vendor”) to create the Converted eBook at a rate that has been established between the Designated Vendor and the Rights Holder (the “Conversion Cost.”)  The Rights Holder shall provide the Company with written notice of the name and contact information for the Designated Vendor, the Conversion Cost, and any supporting documentation or other verification as may be reasonably requested by the Company.</p>

<p>In the event that the Company releases Supporter information to the Rights Holder, or invites Supporters to share such information with the Rights Holder, Rights Holders agree to treat such information in a manner consistent with the Company’s <a href="http://unglue.it/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<p>Once an Unglue.it Campaign has been launched, neither the Subject Work nor any of the Premiums may be revoked or modified, except that either may be supplemented provided that the Digital License Fee is not increased. The Rights Holder understands that a pledge does not become a donation, and that no pledged monies are collected from Supporters, until the Campaign Goal is reached.  The Rights Holder further understands that any pledge may be declined or any donation returned or recovered for any reason or for no reason at the sole discretion of the Company and/or the Payment Processor.</p>

<p>Contributions shall not be collected by the Company from Supporters until the Campaign is successfully completed and the Campaign Goal met or exceeded.  In the event that any of the promised Contributions cannot be collected by the Company or its Payment Processor after the date of the successful conclusion of the Campaign, the Rights Holder understands that neither the Company nor the Payment Processor shall have any obligation whatsoever in connection with the collection of such monies.  The Rights Holder understands and knowingly accepts the risk that the actual Contributions collected or capable of collection may be less than the total Contributions promised by the Supporters individually or in the aggregate.  The Rights Holder understands that it is obligated to release the Converted eBook and to ship the promised Premiums even if the actual Contributions collected are less than the Campaign Goal.</p>

<p>Immediately upon the date of the conclusion of a successful Unglue.it Campaign, the Rights Holder agrees to and hereby does grant to the Company the right (but not the obligation) to place the Subject Work in the Internet Archive [archive.org] or such other open digital libraries as the Company may select in its sole discretion, and to distribute the Subject Work on the Website, whether directly or indirectly, provided that the copyright notice and mark of the applicable CC License is at all times clearly displayed in association with the Subject Work.</p>

<p>Rights Holders are solely responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with their use of the Service. No Sales Commission will be refunded for any reason, even in the event that a Campaign is removed from the Website by the Company. </p>

<p>Rights Holders may initiate refunds at their own discretion. Unglue.it is not responsible for issuing refunds for funds that have been collected by Rights Holders.</p>

<p>No later than seven (7) days from the receipt by the Company of the Rights Holder’s Confirmation of Fulfillment or, where applicable, satisfactory Fulfillment Verification, the Company shall transfer into an approved account designated by the Rights Holder for this purpose, all monies actually received from the Supporters in connection with the Unglue.it Campaign for the Subject Work (the “Contributions,”) minus the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>	any transaction fees deducted or otherwise charged to the Company by the Payment Processor;</li>
	<li>	any transaction fees deducted or other charges imposed by the Rights Holder’s respective banks, credit card companies or other financial institutions in connection with the Contributions;</li>
	<li>	the Company’s Sales Commission as set at the start of the Campaign</li>
	<li>	reimbursement of the Company’s actual costs for production of a Standard Ebook File for the Subject Work, in the event that no confirmation of Fulfillment is timely delivered to the Company;</li>
	<li>	any Conversion Costs payable to any Designated Vendor. </li>
</ol>

<p>Though Unglue.it cannot be held liable for the actions of a Rights Holder, Rights Holders are nevertheless wholly responsible for fulfilling obligations both implied and stated in any Campaign listing they create. Unglue.it reserves the right to cancel a Campaign, refund any or all Contributions, and cancel any or all Supporters’ pledges at any time for any reason. Unglue.it reserves the right to cancel, interrupt, suspend, or remove a Campaign listing at any time for any reason.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in or implied by this Agreement, all payment obligations undertaken by the Company in connection with any Campaign are expressly subject to the Platform Services Agreement entered into between the Rights Holder and the Company. </p>

<p>	The Company may suspend or terminate the account of any Rights Holder at any time in the event that the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that (i) the Rights Holder’s use of the Service is in violation of this Agreement; (ii) the Rights Holder is in breach of any of its representations, warrantees or obligations under this Agreement or the Platform Services Agreement; (iii) the Company receives a complaint from a third party alleging that the Rights Holder’s use of the Service does or will result in copyright infringement or breach of contract.</p>
