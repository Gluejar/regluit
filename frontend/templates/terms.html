<a id="acceptance"><h3>Acceptance of Terms</h3></a>

<p>Welcome to Unglue.it, the website and online service of Gluejar, Inc. (the “Company”, "Unglue.it" "we," or "us"). Unglue.it is a crowd funding and revenue platform that facilitates the distribution and licensing of copyrighted literary works. The mechanism by which Rights Holders collect Contributions and license revenue from Ungluers using the Service is known as a “Campaign.” A Campaign is either a "Pledge Campaign" or a "Buy-to-Unglue Campaign". In a Pledge Campaign, the holder(s) of rights to a copyrighted literary work (the “Rights Holder”) can use the Unglue.it Service to accept and collect contributions in exchange for the release of the work, in digital form, under a Creative Commons License. In a Buy-to-Unglue Campaign, the Rights Holder can use the Unglue.it Service to sell licenses of the work in exchange for a specified advance of the date specified for release under the Creative Commons License.</p>


<p>This terms of use agreement (the "Agreement") governs the use of the Unglue.it website (the “Website”) and the service owned and operated by Gluejar (collectively with the Website, the “Service”) by all persons and/or entities who visit the Website and/or use the Service (“you”.) This Agreement also incorporates the Privacy Policy available at <a href="https://Unglue.it/privacy">Unglue.it/privacy</a>, and all other operating rules, policies and procedures that may be published from time to time on the Website by Company, each of which is incorporated by reference and each of which may be updated by Company from time to time.  You accept Company’s posting of any changes to this Agreement on the Website as sufficient notice of such change.  In addition, some services offered through the Service may be subject to additional terms promulgated by Company from time to time, which may be posted on the Website or sent to you via email or otherwise; your use of such services is subject to those additional terms, which are incorporated into these Terms of Use by this reference. By using this site in any manner, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, whether or not you are a registered user of our Service.

<a id="supporting"><h3>Supporting a Pledge Campaign</h3></a>

<p>Becoming a registered user of Unglue.it is free of charge. However, Unglue.it may provide you the opportunity to make contributions or pledges (collectively, “Contributions”) to Pledge Campaigns listed on the Service. You may contribute to any active Pledge Campaign in any amount you choose, up to the specified maximum. You may contribute to as many Campaigns as you like.  By making a pledge, you authorize Company to collect the amount pledged from your designated account without further notice or authorization once a Campaign Goal is reached, at which time a pledge becomes a contribution. </p>

<p>You are not required to contribute to any Pledge Campaign. You understand that making a Contribution to a Pledge Campaign does not give you any rights in or to that Campaign or its associated work(s), including without limitation any ownership, control, or distribution rights. You understand that the Rights Holder shall be free to collect other Contributions to the Campaign, enter into contracts with third parties in connection with the Campaign, and otherwise direct the Campaign in its sole discretion without any notice to you. You further understand that nothing in this Agreement or otherwise limits Company's right to enter into agreements or business relationships relating to Campaigns or to the literary works that are the subject of Campaigns (“Subject Works.”)  Unglue.it does not guarantee that any Pledge Campaign’s goal will be met. As part of a Campaign, Rights Holders may offer you thank-you gifts, perks, rewards or other signs of gratitude (“Premiums.”)  Any Premiums offered to you are between you and the Rights Holder only, and Unglue.it does not guarantee that Premiums will be delivered or satisfactory to you. You understand that your pledge may be declined by Company, by the Payment Processor (defined below) or by the Rights Holder at their sole discretion. Unglue.it makes no representations whatsoever in connection with the use of any Contributions or the outcome of any Campaign.</p>

<p>Once a Contribution is made, it is nonrefundable. In the event of a suspended or withdrawn campaign, pledges will be allowed to expire according to their original time limits. If a suspended campaign is resolved and reactivated within a pledge’s time limit, that pledge will remain active.</p>

<p>You acknowledge and agree that all your Contributions are between you and the Rights Holder only, and that Unglue.it is not responsible for Contribution transactions, including without limitation any personal or payment information you provide to the Payment Processor.</p>

<p>Unglue.it is not a registered charity and Contributions are not charitable donations for tax purposes.  Company makes no representations whatsoever regarding the tax deductibility of any Contribution. You are encouraged consult your tax advisor in connection with your Contribution.</p>

The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to select Payment Processors for this purpose and/or to change the Payment Processor without notice to you. </p>

<p>You understand that funds pledged to a Pledge Campaign are not debited from your account until the  Campaign to which the Ungluer has contributed has concluded and the Campaign Goal has been met. You further appreciate that Rights Holders act in reliance on your pledge in determining whether their Campaign Goal has been met. You agree to maintain a sufficient balance in the account from which your contribution is to be paid to cover the full amount of the pledged Contribution at the conclusion of a successful Campaign.</p>

<p>You understand that the Service is simply a platform for the conduct of Pledge Campaigns. When you make a pledge, and/or request a Premium using the Service or otherwise, the Rights Holder is solely responsible for delivery of any and all Premiums, goods and services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations made to the Ungluer in connection with a Campaign (“Fulfillment.”) You hereby release the Company and its officers, employees, agents, licensees and assignees from any and all loss, damage or other liability that may arise out of the Ungluer’s participation in an Campaign based on insufficient Fulfillment or otherwise.</p>

<p>You understand and agree that delivery of a Premium, and/or distribution of a Creative Commons licensed work, may not occur until a period of time after the conclusion of a successful Pledge Campaign.  Such a delay may occur, for example, when production or conversion of the Premium or digital work is not completed before the conclusion of the campaign.</p>

<p>You authorize the Company to hold funds for up to ninety (90) days following the conclusion of a Pledge Campaign, pending proof of fulfillment by the Rights Holder.</p>

<a id="supportingb2u"><h3>Supporting a Buy-To-Unglue Campaign</h3></a>

<a id="rightsholders"><h3>Campaigns: Additional Terms for Rights Holders</h3></a>
<p>
The Company's mission is to make copyrighted literary works freely and readily available to all who wish to read them in digital form, while ensuring that authors, publishers and other copyright owners are compensated for their efforts and investment in creating and developing such works.  </p>

<p>The Company invites and encourages Rights Holders to propose Works for Creative Commons licensing via Campaigns.  Rights Holders have to apply to the Company to initiate campaigns and, upon acceptance, the Rights Holder must enter into a Platform Services Agreement with the Company prior to starting a Campaign.</p>

<p>Rights Holders who have executed a Platform Services Agreement may claim works and may initiate and conduct Campaigns as described in the Rights Holder Tools page at <a href="https://unglue.it/rightsholders/">https://unglue.it/rightsholders/</a>.</p>

<p>There is no charge for Rights Holders to launch a Campaign using the Service. However, the Company will withhold a “Sales Commission”  as specified in the Platform Services Agreement. The Rights Holder is responsible for providing a Standard Ebook File at their own expense. </p>

<p>The Rights Holder hereby authorizes the Company to use the Service to display and market the Subject Work, to collect Contributions and License Fees or cause them to be collected from Ungluers on behalf of the Rights Holder, and to retain, reserve and/or distribute the Contributions to the Rights Holder, to the Company, to Designated Vendors (as defined below) or otherwise pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  </p>

<p>The Rights Holder acknowledges and understands that the Company uses one or more third party payment processing services to collect Contributions and/or for the distribution of Contributions to the Rights Holder or otherwise pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (the “Payment Processor.”) The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to select Payment Processors for this purpose and to change Payment Processors at any time, with or without notice to the Rights Holder.  The Rights Holder hereby consents to any and all modifications of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement as may be required or requested by the Payment Processor from time to time as a condition of continuing service to the Company or otherwise.  The Rights Holder understands and agrees that the Company may hold funds for up to 90 days after collection, and that Payment Processors may withhold funds for various reasons according to their own terms of service.</p>

<p>The duration of any single Pledge Campaign shall be determined by the Rights Holder, provided that no single Campaign shall be longer than one hundred eighty (180) days.</p>

<p>No Premium may be offered on the Website that constitutes an illegal, prohibited or restricted item in the United States.  Items that are prohibited or restricted by the Company  include, but are not limited to, alcoholic beverages, firearms, knives or other weapons, drugs, drug-like substances and paraphernalia, counterfeit currency and stamps, credit cards, electronic surveillance equipment, hazardous materials, medical devices, or any other item that is illegal.  The Company reserves the right to remove Premium items from the Website in its sole discretion and without notice to the Rights Holder.</p>

<p>The Rights Holder shall not, whether as a Premium or otherwise, use the Service to offer any financial incentive to potential Ungluers.  The prohibition against financial incentives expressly includes, but is not limited to, a share of profits or ownership interest in any entity, interest payable on any Contributions, or any Premium that would require registration under the securities laws of any country or state, including but not limited to the state or federal securities laws and regulations of the United States.</p>

<p>The Standard Ebook File shall meet the following  set of criteria:</p>
<ul class="terms">
<li>Unless otherwise permitted in writing by Unglue.it, the file shall use the EPUB standard format format according to best practice at time of submission. Exceptions will be made for content requiring more page layout than available in prevailing EPUB implementations.</li>
<li>The file shall be compliant where ever reasonable with the QED inspection checklist specified at <a href="http://www.publishinginnovationawards.com/featured/qed">http://www.publishinginnovationawards.com/featured/qed </a> </li>
<li>The file should have no more than 0.2 typographical or scanning errors per page of English text.</li>
<li>The file shall contain front matter which includes the following:
<ul class="terms">
<li>a list of ISBNs of other editions of the work</li>
<li> <i>For Pledge Camaigns only</i><ol>
<li>the Creative Commons license selected for the campaign, formatted in accordance with best practices at <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Marking/Creators">http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Marking/Creators</a>, and a statement that for the purposes of the license, "Non-Commercial" use shall include, but not be limited to, the distribution of the Work by a commercial entity without charge.</li>
<li>an acknowledgement of Ungluers of the work, formatted in accordance with the premium descriptions on the Campaign page.</li>
<li>The Unglue.it logo</li>
<li>the text “CC edition release enabled by Unglue.it users” (including the hyperlink to the site)</li>
<li>The Rights Holder must offer the schedule of Standard Premiums as described at at ( <a href="https://unglue.it/rightsholders/">https://unglue.it/rightsholders/</a>) in effect at the time of  launching a Pledge Campaign.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><i>For Buy-To-Unglue Campaigns</i>, the Unglue.it platform will embed a personalized licensed statement into front matter for each delivered file</li>
</ul>
<li>The cover graphic shall match any description given in the Campaign.</li>
<li>Any graphics which must be excluded from the released ebook shall be specified in the description given in the campaign.
</ul>

<p>To provide confirmation of Fulfillment and become eligible to receive Contributions made  in a successful Pledge Campaign, the Rights Holder shall either make available to the Company a Standard Ebook File for the work, or the Rights Holder shall designate a third party vendor from a list of vendors approved by the Company (the “Designated Vendor”) to create the Converted eBook at a rate that has been established between the Designated Vendor and the Rights Holder (the “Conversion Cost.”)  The Rights Holder shall provide the Company with written notice of the name and contact information for the Designated Vendor, the Conversion Cost, and any supporting documentation or other verification as may be reasonably requested by the Company.</p>

<p>In the event that the Company releases Ungluer information to the Rights Holder, or invites Ungluers to share such information with the Rights Holder, Rights Holders agree to treat such information in a manner consistent with the Company’s <a href="https://unglue.it/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<p>Once a Pledge Campaign has been launched, neither the Subject Work nor any of the Premiums may be revoked or modified, except that either may be supplemented provided that the Campaign Goal is not increased. The Rights Holder understands that a pledge does not become a contribution, and that no pledged monies are collected from Ungluers, until the Campaign Goal is reached.  The Rights Holder further understands that any pledge may be declined or any contribution returned or recovered for any reason or for no reason at the sole discretion of the Company and/or the Payment Processor.</p>

<p>Contributions to a Pledge Campaign shall not be collected from Ungluers until the Campaign is successfully completed and the Campaign Goal met or exceeded.  In the event that any of the promised Contributions cannot be collected by the Company or its Payment Processor after the date of the successful conclusion of the Campaign, the Rights Holder understands that neither the Company nor the Payment Processor shall have any obligation whatsoever in connection with the collection of such monies.  The Rights Holder understands and knowingly accepts the risk that the actual Contributions collected or capable of collection may be less than the total Contributions promised by the Ungluers individually or in the aggregate.  The Rights Holder understands that it is obligated to release the Converted eBook and to ship the promised Premiums even if the actual Contributions collected are less than the Campaign Goal.</p>

<p>A Buy-To-Unglue campaign is deemed successful on its Effective Ungluing Date. The Effective Ungluing Date is determined as follows:
<ol>
<li> Before the launch of a Buy-To-Unglue Campaign, the Rights Holder selects an "Initial Ungluing Date". Once the campaign is launched, the Initial Ungluing Date cannot be changed, and the Rights Holder Commits to the Release of the work on that date, even if no licensing revenue is earned. can't be changed. The Initial Ungluing Date be any date before January 1, 2100.</li>
<li>Before the launch of a Buy-To-Unglue Campaign, the Rights Holder selects a campaign goal. After Campaign launch , the goal can be lowered, but never raised.</li>
<li>After launch, the Effective Ungluing Date is determined by the following formulae:
<pre> 
(days per dollar) = [(initial ungluing date) - (campaign launch date)] / (campaign goal)
(current ungluing date) = (initial ungluing date) - (gross revenue)*(days per dollar)
</pre></li></ol>

<p> The Rights Holder is responsible for setting the license fees for individual licenses and for library licenses. These fees can be increased or decreased during the course of the Campaign.</p>


<p>Immediately upon the date of the conclusion of a successful Campaign, the Rights Holder agrees to and hereby does grant to the Company the right (but not the obligation) to place the Subject Work in the Internet Archive [archive.org] or such other open digital libraries as the Company may select in its sole discretion, and to distribute the Subject Work at no charge on the Website, whether directly or indirectly, provided that the copyright notice and mark of the applicable CC License is at all times clearly displayed in association with the Subject Work.</p>

<p>Rights Holders are solely responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with their use of the Service. No Sales Commission will be refunded for any reason, even in the event that a Campaign is removed from the Website by the Company. </p>

<p>Rights Holders may initiate refunds at their own discretion. Unglue.it is not responsible for issuing refunds for funds that have been collected by Rights Holders.</p>

<p>No later than seven (7) days from the receipt by the Company of the Rights Holder’s Confirmation of Fulfillment or, where applicable, satisfactory Fulfillment Verification, the Company shall transfer into an approved account designated by the Rights Holder for this purpose, all monies actually received from the Ungluers in connection with the Pledge Campaign for the Subject Work (the “Contributions”), minus the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>	any transaction fees deducted or otherwise charged to the Company by the Payment Processor;</li>
	<li>	any transaction fees deducted or other charges imposed by the Rights Holder’s respective banks, credit card companies or other financial institutions in connection with the Contributions;</li>
	<li>	the Company’s Sales Commission as set at the start of the Campaign</li>
	<li>	reimbursement of the Company’s actual costs for production of a Standard Ebook File for the Subject Work, in the event that no confirmation of Fulfillment is timely delivered to the Company;</li>
	<li>	any Conversion Costs payable to any Designated Vendor. </li>
</ol>

<p>For Buy-to-Unglue Campaigns, the Company shall pay the Rights Holder quarterly (or more frequently at the discretion of the Company) in arrears, payable on the fifteenth day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, such payment to cover the previous calendar quarter.  For example, payments due in connection with transactions that occur January 1 through March 31 will be paid to the Rights Holder on April 15 of the same year.  Each payment shall be accompanied by a statement detailing sales and licensing data, revenues received, return data, reserve and Distribution Fees withheld.  Notwithstanding the above, quarterly payments may be deferred until the following pay period in the event that the amount payable to the Rights Holder for any given pay period is less than $100.</p>

<p>Though Unglue.it cannot be held liable for the actions of a Rights Holder, Rights Holders are nevertheless wholly responsible for fulfilling obligations both implied and stated in any Campaign listing they create. Unglue.it reserves the right to cancel a Campaign, refund any or all Contributions, and cancel any or all Ungluers’ pledges at any time for any reason. Unglue.it reserves the right to cancel, interrupt, suspend, or remove a Campaign listing at any time for any reason.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in or implied by this Agreement, all payment obligations undertaken by the Company in connection with any Campaign are expressly subject to the Platform Services Agreement entered into between the Rights Holder and the Company. </p>

<p>	The Company may suspend or terminate the account of any Rights Holder at any time in the event that the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that (i) the Rights Holder’s use of the Service is in violation of this Agreement; (ii) the Rights Holder is in breach of any of its representations, warrantees or obligations under this Agreement or the Platform Services Agreement; (iii) the Company receives a complaint from a third party alleging that the Rights Holder’s use of the Service does or will result in copyright infringement or breach of contract.</p>
