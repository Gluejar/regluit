{% comment %}
django-notification and {% with %} play poorly together. Don't use {% with %} 
in child templates.  Also don't do {% url something as something %}; it doesn't work and I'm not clear why.

Exception: you can include notification/sharing_block.html into a notice.html to have
tweet, FB, email sharing show up.  Include a {% url work your.local.work.id as work_url %} immediately prior.
{% endcomment %}
