Hooray!  A rights holder, {{ rightsholder }}, has claimed {{ claim.work.title }}, a work on your wishlist at  Unglue.it.

What does this mean for you?  Rights holders are the people who are legally authorized to license works.  This means they're the only people who can run campaigns on Unglue.it.

{{ rightsholder }} may be running a campaign soon, or later, but isn't obligated to.  Want to make that campaign happen?  Leave a comment (https://{{current_site.domain}}{% url work campaign.work.id %}?tab=2) and tell your friends: make sure {{ rightsholder }} knows how much you want to give this book to the world.

Thanks for your help!

{{ rightsholder }} and the Unglue.it team
