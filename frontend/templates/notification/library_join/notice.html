		<p>{{ library }} is participating in Unglue.it. That means you can borrow Unglue.it ebooks owned by {{ library }} (when available). Here's <a href="{% url library library.user %}">a list of the ebooks available</a> to {{ library }} members. <p>
		
		<p>When you buy an ebook through unglue.it, you'll be offered the option to by a library license in stead of an individual license. That means that {{ library }} will own the ebook, but you'll be the first in line to borrow it. After two weeks, the book will be available to other members of {{ library }}. </p>
		
		<p> eBooks available for purchase through Unglue.it will eventually be free to the whole world, for free. Every purchase of a book through Unglue.it brings the "ungluing date" of that book closer to the present. We hope you'll join us in our effort to make these books free.</p>
