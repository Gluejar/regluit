        Do you have a <b>book you love so much</b> you'd like everyone to read it?  These are the books that <span class="ungluer"></span> is helping to give to the world, right now.
    </p>
    <p>
		<span class="ungluer"></span> wants everyone to be able to read these books -- for free, on their favorite devices, worldwide -- but also wants the book's creators to earn a living.  Traditionally, readers pay <i>every</i> time they buy a book.  But what if it worked more like public radio?  What if creators got enough money to cover their costs and make their efforts worthwhile, and then the book were free to all?  That's what Unglue.it does.  Creators decide how much they need to earn, and then, through campaigns at Unglue.it, people everywhere chip in -- people like <span class="ungluer"></span>.
    </p>
    <p>
    	These books have active campaigns running, right now.  Every time an Ungluer like <span class="ungluer"></span> buys an ebook, or pledges to support one, the day comes closer when the book will be free to everyone.  And when that happens, these books will be free for you, and everyone else, to read and share.
    </p>

        What if your favorite book were on this list?
