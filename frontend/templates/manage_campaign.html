	The "ask" will be displayed to a user who has clicked a "Download" button. It's your chance to ask for their support. 
	The user can decide to make a contribution and go enter a credit card, or can scroll down to download.

	<h4>Editing premiums</h4>
	<p>At this time, you can't edit a premium you've created. But you can deactivate a premium and add a new one to replace it. So be sure to double-check your spelling before adding it.</p>
	
	<p>If you deactivate a premium that people have pledged toward, you are <b>still responsible for delivering it</b> to those pledgers.</p>
	
	<p>A few things to keep in mind:</p>
	<ul class="bullets">
	<li>Are your premiums cumulative?  That is, if you have a $10 and a $25 premium, does the $25 pledger get everything that the $10 pledger gets also?  Either cumulative or not-cumulative is fine, but make sure you've communicated clearly</li>
	<li>Adding new premiums during your campaign is a great way to build momentum.  If you do, make sure to leave a comment in the Comments tab of your campaign page to tell supporters (it will be automatically emailed to them).  Some of them may want to change (hopefully increase) their pledge to take advantage of it.</li>
	<li>Also make sure to think about how your new premiums interact with old ones.  If you add a new premium at $10, will people who have already pledged $25 be automatically eligible for it or not?  Again, you can choose whatever you want; just be sure to communicate clearly.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Acknowledgements</h4>
	<p>Your ungluers will also automatically receive the following acknowledgements:</p>
	<ul class="terms">
		<li><em>Any amount</em> &#8212; The unglued ebook</li>
		<li><em>$25 and above</em> &#8212; Their name in the acknowledgements section under "supporters"</li>
		<li><em>$50 and above</em> &#8212; Their name &amp; profile link under "benefactors"</li>
		<li><em>$100 and above</em> &#8212; Their name, profile link, &amp; a dedication under "bibliophiles"</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Your premium values may be any amounts -- you do not need to offer premiums at $25/$50/$100.  For example, if you offer a $30 premium, anyone pledging to it will be eligible for the $25 reward.  This will be communicated to them during the pledging process; you do not need to explain it in your pitch.</p>

<li>Tell your friends, relatives, media contacts, professional organizations, social media networks -- everyone!</li>

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>When you're logged in, the "Ungluers" tab on the <a href="{% url work work.id %}">campaign page</a> will tell you a bit about each ungluer- when they last pledged, for example, and you can send individual messages to each ungluer. Use this tool with care! You can see who your biggest supporters are by looking at the <a href="{% url work_acks campaign.work.id %}">sample acknowledgement page</a>. 
After your campaign succeeds, you can used this page to generate epub code for the acknowledgements section of your unglued ebook.
