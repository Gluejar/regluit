	<h3>Make Your Pitch</h3>
	<p>This will be displayed in the Campaign tab for your work.  It's your main pitch to supporters.</p>
	
	<p>This isn't a dry synopsis in a catalog.  It's your chance to be creative, to share your passion for this work, and to inspire readers.  A strong pitch:</p>
	
	<ul class="terms">
	<li>Introduces the work.  What's this book like?</li>
	<li>Shows why it matters.  How will someone or something -- the world, readers, some cause that matters -- be better off if this book is freely available?  What kind of impact has the book had already?  What will ungluers get out of supporting this campaign?</li>
	<li>Has visual appeal (photos and/or videos).</li>
	<li>Defines important but potentially unfamiliar things.  What's an ungluing campaign, and why are you running one?  Is there anything unusual about the book, its genre, et cetera?  For those who aren't already familiar with you (or the author), who are you?  Are you offering any particularly great premiums you want to call people's attention to?</li>
	<li>Gives examples of the author's work.  This could be links to your site or places people can find more information about you or the book.  You can also add quotes, embed a free sample chapter or story, display images, et cetera.  These work samples might be from the campaign book itself, or from your (or the author's) other creative works.</li>
	<li>Has personality.  The writing should be thoroughly proofread but it should have a point of view.  This is the place to be conversational, opinionated, funny, quirky -- whatever reflects your style.  Be you.</li>
	<li>Optionally, provides extra incentives (like new or improved premiums) that will kick in if the campaign is unusually successful.  Will you do something special when you reach 10% or 50% or 75% of your goal?  Or if you reach that milestone before a particular deadline (e.g. in the first week of your campaign)?</li>
	{% comment %}
	<li>Hyperlinks for the author(s), publisher making the offer, or for the work itself. <span class="rh_help" id="helpHyperlink">(How do I hyperlink?)</span>
	<div class="rh_answer" id="helpHyperlink2">
	<p>Format a hyperlink like this:</p>
	<p>&lt;a href="http://your_link_here"&gt;your link title here&lt;/a&gt;</p>
	<p>For example:</p>
	<p>&lt;a href="http://www.archive.org"&gt;the Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;</p>
	<p>will display as <a href="http://www.archive.org">the Internet Archive</a>.</p>
	<p>Copy-paste the code above and substitute your own values.  You will find the link address in the location bar of your browser.</p>
	</div></li>
	<li>Anything especially appealing about the work or author: awards, embedded video (445px max), etc. <span class="rh_help" id="helpEmbed">(How do I embed video?)</span>
	<div id="helpEmbed2" class="rh_answer">
	<p>To embed a video from YouTube:</p>
	<p>Go to the page where you watch the video.  Under the video, click "Share".</p>
	<p>A new set of options will open up.  Click the "Embed" button.</p>
	<p>This will generate some code for you to copy/paste into the box below.  It will look something like this:</p>
	<p>&lt;iframe width="444" height="301" src="<span style="color:red">http:</span>//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/adeDb0BRMZY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p>
	<p>Copy/paste that text into the box below.  Delete the part that says "http:" (shown in red in the example).  You're done!  We'll figure out the details.</p>
	<p>Of course, if you want to include other text in addition to video, you can do that.</p>
	<p>If you'd like to change the size of the video, feel free; just don't make it more than 445px wide.  Leaving it the default size is fine, too.</p>
	<p>If you'd like to embed a video from another source, please talk to us. You certainly can; we just want to make sure we've given you the right instructions.</p>
	</div></li>
	{% endcomment %}
	</ul>
	<p>Above all, be engaging.  The point here is not to tell ungluers everything about your book; it's to remind them why they love it.</p>

	<h3>Edition and Rights Details</h3>
	<p>This will be displayed on the Rights tab for your work.  It's the fine print for your campaign.  Make sure to disclose any ways the unglued edition will differ from the existing edition; for example:
	<ul>
	<li>Any material that may have to be excluded due to permissions issues: illustrations, forewords, etc.</li>
	<li>Any additional materials that will be included, if not already covered in your pitch -- but we encourage you to cover them there to show supporters the value of ungluing!</li>
	<li>If the cover image will differ.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>In short, is there a fact about this campaign that you think would matter to your agent or another publishing wonk, but that no one else is likely to care about?  Put it here.  If your campaign doesn't have any fine print, you can leave this blank.</p>

	<h3>Target Price</h3>
	<p>This is the target price for your campaign. The <i>minimum</i> target is ${{form.minimum_target|intcomma}}.</p>
	
	<p>Your target should be high enough to compensate you for potential lost future revenue from sales of this edition and reflect well on your brand, but low enough to seem realistic to supporters; people are more likely to back campaigns that they think will succeed.</p>
	
	<p>Once you launch the campaign, you'll be able to decrease your target, but not increase it.</p>

	<h3>Ending date</h3>
