<h4>Help us unglue this book!</h4>
<p>De Gruyter has agreed to run an ungluing campaign for this book, if it can get enough support from ungluers like you.  The target price will be $2100, after which the book will be free for everyone on earth to read, copy, and share, forever (under a Creative Commons <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">BY-NC-ND</a> license).</p>

<p>They'll launch a campaign when 50 ungluers have wished for this book.  Right now <span id="wisher_data"></span>. </p>
