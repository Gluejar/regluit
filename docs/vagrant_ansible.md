**Instructions on how to use vagrant/ansible**


To use vagrant/ansible to build the `{please|just|}.unglue.it`, you 
need to have the following installed:

* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/) (e.g., to download: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) (at least version 1.8.1)
* [Installation — Ansible Documentation](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html#latest-releases-via-pip) (version 2+) -- use `pip install ansible`

We also need the `vagrant-aws vagrant plugin:

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-aws --plugin-version 0.5.0
```

Optionally you can [VirtualBox – Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox) to enable the build of machines locally.


Layout of important files:

* [Vagrantfile](https://github.com/Gluejar/regluit/blob/1ac55c4f0a6b6a3dfc97652aa5ce33638a6140a1/vagrant/Vagrantfile), which is what `vagrant` looks for and defines various hosts: `please`, `just`, `just2`, `prod`, and `prod2`. 
* [dev.yml](https://github.com/Gluejar/regluit/blob/1ac55c4f0a6b6a3dfc97652aa5ce33638a6140a1/vagrant/dev.yml) -- the main ansible playbook that builds the various machines

* `please` is for buiding `please.unglue.it` -- it is a transient machine
* the reason I have a `just` *group* with `just` and `just2` hosts is while one is in production, I build the new one.  Once the new one is working, I can `vagrant stop` and then ultimately `vagrant destroy` the old one.
* similar logic for the production *group*. (Note that before I retire a production server, I copy over the logs to S3: [backing up production logs to S3](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/f12406a7-de95-4d54-809d-9f3abe8eaabd/f935e813d8f16f25))


You also need AWS keys in the environment.  I have my key/secret pair configured with a shell script that I can run -- I've stored this file in `/Volumes/ryvault1/gluejar/other_keys/aws.sh`, stored in an encrypted volume on my laptop.  For convenience I link to the file from `~/bin/gj_aws.sh`:


```
#!/bin/bash

# rdhyee key: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/users/rdhyee
# eric: you can use the credentials from https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/users/eric

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[FILL IN]
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[FILL IN]
export AWS_KEYPAIR_NAME=[FILL IN]

```

e.g.,

```
hyptyposis-2014:vagrant raymondyee$ ls -lt ~/bin/gj_aws.sh
lrwxr-xr-x  1 raymondyee  501  43 Aug 18  2014 /Users/raymondyee/bin/gj_aws.sh -> /Volumes/ryvault1/gluejar/other_keys/aws.sh
```

In the `regluit/vagrant` directory, after one instantiates the three environment variables (e.g., by running `~/bin/gj_aws.sh)` and then `vagrant status`, you should see something like (the actual status of various machines can vary):

```
please                    not created (virtualbox)
just                      running (aws)
just2                     not created (virtualbox)
prod                      not created (virtualbox)
prod2                     running (aws)
```

Once you have `vagrant status` works, a good place to start is how to build `please` with

```
vagrant up please --provider=aws
```

## secrets and use encrypted key

API keys and passwords used in configuring instances are encrypted using [ansible-vault](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_vault.html). To decrypt or encrypt the file, you need to use the make the password known to `ansible-vault`.  A convenient way is to store the password in a file and set the `ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE` environment variable to the path of that file.  e.g., 

```
export ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE=[path]
```

To use `git diff` with these encrypted files, see the
[.gitattributes](https://github.com/Gluejar/regluit/blob/open_source/.gitattributes) has been added to allow for using `git diff` with `ansible-vault` files: [git - How to diff ansible vault changes? - Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29937195/how-to-diff-ansible-vault-changes/39511274#39511274).  One highlight from the tips, run:


```
git config --global diff.ansible-vault.textconv "ansible-vault view"
```
