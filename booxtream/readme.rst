This is a thin Python (2.6+) wrapper for BooXtream's API for watermarking epub files. It's configured to look for parameters in Django settings files:
BOOXTREAM_API_KEY = ''
BOOXTREAM_API_USER = ''
BOOXTREAM_TEST_EPUB = ''

version 2.52.

Currently, only the platform method is implemented.

See Tests for usage
